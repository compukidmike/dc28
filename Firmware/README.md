# Firmware

firmware.bin is the firmware that originally came on the badge.

Firmware can be flashed via USB without any special tools. If you hold the mode button when turning on the badge while it's connected via USB, it will enter firmware update mode. It will show up as a flash drive on your computer. You can simply delete the "firmware.bin" file and copy the new firmware to it. Then power cycle it and the firmware is updated!
